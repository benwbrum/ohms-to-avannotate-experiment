              "text": "A 5th generation Texas, Norma CantÃº grew up in Brownsville in the 1950âs. Education was important in her family, and CantÃºâs mother used a connection from a friend to get Norma and her brother into a preschool. By the time she went to Webb Elementary, she was able to skip 1st grade. The school system was unfair: they would make Spanish-speaking students take every grade twice, causing many students to drop out. Following Webb she went to Annie S. Putegnat Elementary School. The schoolâs facilities were in poor condition. She skipped 6th grade and went straight to junior high. Then she went to Brownsville High, where  teachers and students had to deal with overcrowding and lack of funding. She then went to Texas Southmost College to stay close to home and because she got a full ride. She then transferred to Pan American University at Edinburg, where she completed her undergrad in 2 years at the age of 19 with a double major in English and Government with an minor in Education. Her first job out of school was teaching at Brownsville High, where she had been a student just two years prior. Following this she decided follow her dream and apply to law school; she was accepted with a full ride to Harvard, becoming the first Tejana to attend Harvard Law School."

Following her time at the Attorney General's office, CantÃº and her husband moved to San Antonio. She then began working for MALDEF as an education lawyer. CantÃº worked on important cases including Plyler v.s Doe, in which the State of Texas argued that they had the justification to exclude immigrant children from public education.

The Texas Attorney General's office argued that higher education was not a fundamental right. Ultimately a federal judge ruled that State of Texasâ funding format was unconstitutional on the basis of denying students right to a public higher education, but it was not proven that the state acted with intent of racial discrimination."

This unified the border communities as they came together to decide how much each area needed for higher education. The state approved at total of $660,000,000 to go towards investing in higher education along the border. It was after the allocation of these finds that the case was seen in front of the Supreme Court, where they LULAC lost because the region had already been awarded that money. In the years following, that money was put into master's and doctoral programs as well as the creation of medical schools and other professional schools in cities such as Laredo and Corpus Christi. However, CantÃº sees threats to public higher education funding in Texas today."
